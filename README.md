### Description
This mod will add variant portable devices like smartphone, laptop and some stationary machines like desktop computer, refrigerator, etc.   
And of course you can have your own modular electronics. And it will even come with a GUI-based OS that works well.

All devices will require the power. Commonly used Forge Energy(FE).   
This mod will works based on Mekanism. CC:Tweaked is optional. Because this mod is standalone computing mod. So CC:Tweaked is no more required.

You might be wondering why I decided to create a new computing mod. Because ComptuerCraft is using CLI-based VM operating system. We cannot create actual GUI in this environment. GUI with maded ASCII art isn't great for accesible. And CLI is hard to use for gamer. It's professional.   
So I decided to make a real GUI-base VM operating system. Therefore, the purpose is to provide an accessible interface so that many people who have not learned programming can easily use it without excessive hard coding.

Of course, I'm not that good at programming either. I'm still constantly learning about programming. If you'd like to help with coding this, [please join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/tUHk9x7QrF). After completing a survey containing a few questions, you can join the development team right away if you meet the criteria.   
Anyone can participate, regardless of gender or age, and nationality does not matter. Of course, there are preferential treatment for people who can understand and speak Korean, regardless of nationality. 

The reason I make mods is just to make the game more fun. This mod is also intended to make it more enjoyable for many people. After the mod is released, it can be used not only to create maps, but also as part of internet broadcast content, as long as it does not violate copyright.

**It's still in development.**

### Currently development in Minecraft version

| MC version | Status                  |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **1.20**   | **Work in progress**    |
| ~~1.19~~   | Canceled                |
| ~~1.18~~   | Canceled                |
| ~~_1.17_~~ | _Skipped_               |
| ~~_1.16_~~ | _Skipped_               |

The reason why the 1.18.x and 1.19.x has been stopped to development forever, because I have changed my computer to new and most old repositories has been corrupted during data transfer.   
I had tried to fix this problem, but keeps failed. So I decided to focuses creates new one.   
But it's not related to that Curseforge major hacking accident. All sources safe.

As you know, OpenComputer is already dead. I know too. So I decided not to wait any longer.   
I think I've seen other people talk about making a spiritual successor to OC, but even that is dead.

So I decided not to wait any longer for the OC and just create a separate computing mod. However, this mod will be made GUI-based rather than CLI-based so that even beginners can use it easily.   
Although I have declared CC:Tweaked as a dependency for now, this will probably become optional rather than a dependency in the future.

Currently recruiting development staff. I mostly work alone, but I also consider teamwork where possible.

### Comments

The reason this mod have Mekanism as a dependency is because the code for the power system is written based on Mekanism. In addition, modular upgrades and other features are also dependent on Mekanism because they are part of it. In other words, you can think of it as a kind of fan-made add-on.
