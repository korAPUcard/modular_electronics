### Currently development in Minecraft version

| MC version | Status                  | Reason                                         |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1.20       | Work in progress        | Recreating all the sources.                    |
| ~~1.19~~   | Canceled                | Fully canceled. Repository has been corrupted. |
| ~~1.18~~   | Canceled                | Fully canceled. Repository has been corrupted. |
| ~~1.17~~   | Skipped                 | - |
| ~~1.16~~   | Skipped                 | - |

The reason why the 1.18.x and 1.19.x has been stopped to development forever, because I have changed my computer to new and most old repositories has been corrupted during data transfer.   
I had tried to fix this problem, but keeps failed. So I decided to focuses creates new one.   
But it's not related to that major hacking accident. All sources safe.

As you know, OpenComputer is already dead. I know too. So I decided not to wait any longer.   
I think I've seen other people talk about making a spiritual successor to OC, but even that is dead.

So I decided not to wait any longer for the OC and just create a separate computing mod. However, this mod will be made GUI-based rather than CLI-based so that even beginners can use it easily.   
Although I have declared CC:Tweaked as a dependency for now, this will probably become optional rather than a dependency in the future.

Currently recruiting development staff. I mostly work alone, but I also consider teamwork where possible.

### Comments

The reason this mod have Mekanism as a dependency is because the code for the power system is written based on Mekanism. In addition, modular upgrades and other features are also dependent on Mekanism because they are part of it. In other words, you can think of it as a kind of fan-made add-on.
